            <h6>Introduction</h6>

            <p>
              This documentation provides the details on steps used for running
              a Volume Ray Casting project, which allows the visualization of
              NIfTI format images commonly used in neuroimaging. The project
              uses a GitHub repository as its foundation and relies on specific
              dependencies to function properly.

            <p>
              As per the instructions provided, I used the above repository by
              <strong>rordenlab</strong> for this implementation.

                <h6>Understanding the project</h6>
                <p>
                  Before running the "volume ray casting" code, I first
                  familiarized myself with the project and its requirements. I
                  carefully read the project's documentation and explored its
                  repository on GitHub to gain an understanding of its purpose
                  and functionality.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The project utilizes dcm2niix, a tool used to convert medical
                  scanner images to the NIfTI format. This conversion process is
                  necessary to make the images readable by the Volume Ray
                  Casting project.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  As per the project docomentation and code study, WebGL2 has
                  been employed within the project to enable the rendering and
                  display of volumetric visualizations in web browsers. It
                  provides the necessary capabilities for interactive
                  exploration of the NIfTI images.

            <h6>Running the project</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The repo was cloned on a local machine and the code was
                  studied along with the Readme file provided.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  To facilitate local development and testing, the Live Server
                  extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was installed. This
                  extension enabled to run a local server to host the project.
                  Since the entry point of this project was
                  <strong>index.html</strong> file, the live server was
                  initiated from this location using the Live Server extension.
                  This started a local server, allowing the project to run on
                  the local machine.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Code was modified in order to incorporate an extra
                  documentation page in the project. It has been added as
                  explanation page.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h6>Running on web page</h6>
            <p>
              After testing on local machine, the project was deployed on github
              pages server. All of the project files were pushed on the master
              branch of my repo <strong>avizoetic.github.io</strong> which works
              to host a github page for me.
