            More than valentines, this time is special for me because this is
            when we found each other. It's been a year and it feels surreal.
            You've been my sunshine, my happy pill. Everyday feels a little bit
            better knowing that you are with me. I had never imagined I'd find
            something so beautiful, and I am beyond grateful that I found you,
            we found us. You're the besttt and I am so so proud of you. I can't
            wait to be by your side, hold your hands, and see you smile (of
            course with tika and jhumkas too ... heheh).
